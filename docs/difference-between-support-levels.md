We have different levels of support depending on what plan you have with us.

### Standard

Standard support is what we offer Community plan users. You get access to our help centre and email support. We'll get back to you within a working week. 

### Business

Business support comes with our paid plans. We'll get back to as soon as possible, usually within 2 working days. If you submit your query during working hours, we'll try to get back to you within the same day.
